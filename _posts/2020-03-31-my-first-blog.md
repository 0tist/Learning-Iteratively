## Basic setup

## Deep learning is really a powerful metaphor for learning about the world!

Hi All!
Deep Learning / Machine Learning are the latest buzz words that you will hear people talk about a lot, especially those who are affiliated to the tech industry and I'm one of those students who aspire to contribute in the field and grow along with it. I tried my hands on Competitive Programming and really enjoyed doing it, programming competitively significantly improves the skill and extend of understanding but then I wanted to try something new, then I got across one of the youtube suggestions about the advancing career options for the future, eventually I found myself skeptic about the field and soon realised that the applications of Deep Learning are limited to one's imagination, as I progressed I started developing a mathematical intuition around most of the optimized processes around us, which catered my brain and heightened my skepticism.
Deep Learning is inspired from the functioning of our brain and how the neurons work, essentially we try to create equivalent mathematical models to immitate fundamental tasks that every human perfroms on a daily basis, for example: differentiate between various objects(apple or orange), understanding various written texts and blah!
Now Learning, Deep Learning is an Iterative process and requires a lot of commitment towards the programming language one has chosen and all the iterations that you have been through so far, since it's a Young field and cosiderably very active for research, one needs to learn, practise and keeep him/herself updated

## How to learn from this Iterative Process?
By far Python is the most popular language as per the survey of 24,000 Data professionals by Kaggle, some of the few sources from where one can learn python:
- [official python 3 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) 
- [Corey schafer's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g)
- [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using python](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x_7+3T2015/course/)

Now for the Data Science / Machine Learning / Deep Learning there are tons of resources and courses available and I have explored a lot of them, for example:
- [CS229 - machine learning and statistical pattern recognition *By Andrew Ng*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599)
- [CS231n - Computer vision *By Fei Fei Li and associates*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv)
- [CS7015 - IIT Madras Deep learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyqSpQzTE6M9gCgajvQbc68Hk_JKGBAYT)

All these courses are well tailored and are taught by the greatest minds, but there was something unique in the way Prof. Jeremy Howard at USFCA taught [practical deep learning for coders](https://course.fast.ai), watched a couple of videos from his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/howardjeremyp) and found his way of teaching very practical and not much mathematical(besides that high-school mathematics is enough to get satrted with deep learning). He follows a top-down approach which involves coding along side devicing seemingly complex mathematical equations, then I decided to get myself enrolled in Fast.ai course v4 2020, and I'm in the 2nd week of the course, trying to get some insights in the library [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) and [fastai2](https://github.com/fastai/fastai2)

## What is **Fastai** and Why I favor it?
'fastai is a deep learning library which provides practitioners with high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. It aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes:

- A new type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type hierarchy for tensors
- A GPU-optimized computer vision library which can be extended in pure Python
- An optimizer which refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers into two basic pieces,  allowing optimization algorithms to be implemented in 4-5 lines of code
- A novel 2-way callback system that can access any part of the data, model, or optimizer and change it at - any point during training
- A new data block API
...and much more.' --- [source](https://www.fast.ai/2020/02/13/fastai-A-Layered-API-for-Deep-Learning/)

besides the aforementioned points, fastai respects the read–eval–print loop (REPL) environment of the Jupyter Notebook, which is really handy at times. Most Importantly  the layered API doesnt only consist of a high-level and a low-level but also a Mid-level system which helps to transit from the high-level easy to use beginner API to low-level heavily feautured API
There are more aspects to the the Library which I will discuss with the upcoming blogs.
the course closely resembles the book "Deep Learning for coders with Fastai and Pytorch" *by Jeremy Howard & Sylvain gugger* which will be available later this summer.

## About the Blog Posts Series
the motivation behind the bolgs is highly self-centered, as it helps me keep me track of the course and my development, following the advice of Rachel Thomas(co-founder fastai), check out her [blog](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045).
Being on a lockdown rather proved to be helpful as it would be a tedious task to follow along with my univesity lectures.
Will try to make best out of the opportunity and will update you guys on my upcoming posts soon!
stay indoors, stay safe, take care :)

*PS:* Special mention to the amazing community of Fastai and their support on the forums, they are a constant help and will support you throughout your journey in the fastai, there are walkthrus of the fastai code repository available on the youtube, which I will try to include whenever necessary
