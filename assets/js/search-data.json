Deep learning is really a powerful metaphor for learning about the world! . Deep Learning / Machine Learning are the latest buzz words that you will hear people talk about a lot, especially those who are affiliated to the tech industry and I’m one of those students who aspire to contribute in the field and grow along with it. I studied Competitive Programming and really enjoyed it. I have learned that it significantly improves programming skills and the understanding of algorithms. Yet, I found myself wanting to try something different and new, and came across one of youtube’s suggestions about advancing career options for the future in the software field. I became even more inquisitive about this field of study and soon realised that the applications of Deep Learning is limited to one’s imagination. As I progressed I started developing intuition around most of the optimised processes around us, which catered my brain and heightened my skepticism. Deep Learning is inspired by the functioning of human brain and how the neurons work, essentially we try to create equivalent mathematical models to imitate fundamental tasks that every human performs on a daily basis, for instance: differentiation between objects (apple &amp; orange), understanding texts etc. Now Learning, Deep Learning is an Iterative process and requires a lot of commitment to programming language one has chosen and all the iterations that you have been through so far, since it’s a Young field(with respect to its applications in the industry) and considerably very active for research, one needs to learn, practise and keep themselves updated. . How to learn from this Iterative Process? . By far Python is the most popular language as per the survey of 24,000 Data professionals by Kaggle, some of the few sources from where one can learn python: . official python 3 documentation | Corey schafer’s tutorial | Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using python | . Now for the Data Science / Machine Learning / Deep Learning there are tons of resources and courses available and I have explored a lot of them, for example: . CS229 - machine learning and statistical pattern recognition By Andrew Ng | CS231n - Computer vision By Fei Fei Li and associates | CS7015 - IIT Madras Deep learning | . The content of these courses is very well structured and is taught by the greatest minds. There was something unique in the way Prof. Jeremy Howard at USFCA teaches practical deep learning for coders, watched a couple of videos from his YouTube channel and found his way of teaching very comprehensible and not much mathematical. Not to mention, high-school mathematics is enough to get started for deep learning. He follows a top-down approach which involves coding along with devising simple equivalent mathematical equations. Hence, I decided to get myself enrolled in Fast.ai course v4 2020. Currently, I’m in the 2nd week of the course, trying to get some insights in the library fastai and fastai2 . . . What is Fastai and Why I favor it? . ‘fastai is a deep learning library which provides practitioners with high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. It aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes: . A new type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type hierarchy for tensors | A GPU-optimized computer vision library which can be extended in pure Python | An optimizer which refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to be implemented in 4-5 lines of code | A novel 2-way callback system that can access any part of the data, model, or optimizer and change it at - any point during training | A new data block API …and much more.’ — source | . Besides the aforementioned points, fastai respects the read–eval–print loop (REPL) environment of the Jupyter Notebook, which can prove to be very handy at times. Most Importantly the layered API doesn’t only consist of a high-level and a low-level system but also a Mid-level system which helps to transit from the high-level, easy to use beginner API to low-level heavily featured API. There are more aspects to the the Library which I will discuss in the upcoming blogs. The course closely resembles the book “Deep Learning for coders with Fastai and Pytorch” by Jeremy Howard &amp; Sylvain gugger which will be available later this summer. . . About the Blog Posts Series . The motivation behind the bolg is highly self-centered, as it helps me keep track of the course and my development, following the advice of Rachel Thomas(co-founder fastai), check out her blog. Being on a lockdown rather proved to be helpful as it would be a tedious task to follow along with my university lectures. Will try to make best out of the opportunity and will update you guys on my upcoming posts soon! stay indoors, stay safe, take care :) . PS: Special mention to the amazing community of Fastai and their support on the forums, they are a constant help and will support you throughout your journey in the fastai, there are walkthroughs of the fastai code repository available on the youtube, which I will try to include whenever necessary .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # Title &gt; Awesome summary - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .
